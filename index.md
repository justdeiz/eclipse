About this repo
===============
This repo is a collection of my favorite NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games, meant to be used with the browser based Eclipse emulator.

Note: This repo is not intended for piracy, I highly encourage you to only play games you personally own. 
------------------------------------
But if you want to, go ahead. I'm a mediocre web developer, not a cop.
